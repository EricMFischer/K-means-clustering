# K-means-clustering

  This is an investigation to understand the degree to which k-means clustering improves the trading performance of a linear regression model. The model sets out to binomially predict the positive or negative price movement of a volatile stock over an interval in time. Without clustering, I understand a Random Forest as opposed to a generalized linear model implementation would be more accurate with data containing many outliers like the price data of this volatile stock. That is because RF uses nonparametric decision trees, which eliminates the problem of linear separability of data. But my hypothesis is that linear regression models would more effectively improve upon their results if they used clustered subsets of data patterns, as opposed to single price points. These clustered subsets of data, as opposed to single price points, would be more similar to the provided input (e.g. the one hundred most recent unclassified data points) and thus I think would improve the model’s learning. Therefore, I am grouping combinations of one hundred data points, which reflect its changing price over a time interval, clustering them, running linear regression models on this data subset, and comparing this model’s results to the results from a comparable Random Forest implementation. This is one example of research I am interested in, but I am also intrigued by work in neural networks and deep learning.
